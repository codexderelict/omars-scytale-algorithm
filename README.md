INTRODUCTION:

Hello! This is my very first actual programming project. I'm currently on Week 2 of CS50P (loops, lists and dicts), and decided to make something that uses that knowledge. A scytale was a tool used for cryptography. Wikipedia explains it with images (worth 1000 words!)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scytale
This program (so far) only encrypts text, though I plan on adding a decryption function sometime in the future (in the works, just working on debugging)

HOW TO USE:
This is a CLI program. Run it in Python. It'll ask you for the text to be encrypted, then it'll ask you the width of the scytale, and then return the encrypted text. Ez.
